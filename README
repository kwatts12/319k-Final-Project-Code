This is the main file for my final project in my Embedded Systems class. The code impliments a 2 player version of the classic game Brick Breaker on a TM4C123 microcontroller. 
Whereas the classic game was won by acheiving a high score, my version is won by outlasting your opponent. After each level of collectively clearing all of the bricks from the screen, the game 
reloads but starts to move much faster, making it more difficult to keep your ball in the air.
